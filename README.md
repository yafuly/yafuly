Hello! My name is Yafu Li, and I am currently a third-year PhD student under a joint training of Zhejiang University and Westlake University, under the supervision of [Prof. Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/). 

My research focuses on machine translation and natural language generation, with recent work in LLM-related topics. You can find our recent work on detecting AI-generated texts at [DeepfakeTextDetect](https://github.com/yafuly/DeepfakeTextDetect).

I am always open to discussing research, potential collaborations, or opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me at yafuly@gmail.com.
