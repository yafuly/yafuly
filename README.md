Hello! My name is Yafu Li, and I am currently a third-year PhD student under a joint training of Zhejiang University and Westlake University, under the supervision of [Prof. Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/). I earned my Bachelor’s degree from Wuhan University, followed by a Master’s degree from the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Prof. Alex Lascarides](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/alex/).

My research focuses on machine translation and natural language generation, with recent work in LLM-related topics. You can find our recent work on detecting AI-generated texts at [DeepfakeTextDetect](https://github.com/yafuly/DeepfakeTextDetect).

I am always open to discussing research, potential collaborations, or opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me at yafuly@gmail.com.
