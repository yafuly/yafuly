# Welcome to My Research Portfolio üëã

Hi! I am **Yafu Li**, a researcher at Shanghai AI Lab, currently working under the supervision of [Prof. Yu Cheng](https://ych133.github.io/). I earned my PhD through joint training at Zhejiang University and Westlake University under the guidance of [Prof. Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/).

My research focuses on **test-time scaling**, **trustworthy AI**, and **machine translation**.

:sparkles: :sparkles: :sparkles: 
We are looking for **interns** and joint **PhD candidates** (with THU, PKU, SJTU, FDU, etc.) to work on cutting-edge research in large-scale models. Our focus areas include zero reinforcement learning (e.g., R1-zero), test-time scaling, and trustworthy AI. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me at [yafuly@gmail.com](mailto:yafuly@gmail.com).
