Hello! My name is Yafu Li, and I am currently a fourth-year PhD student under joint training of Zhejiang University and Westlake University, under the supervision of [Prof. Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/). My research focuses on natural language generation, with a recent focus on LLM-related topics.

I am always open to discussing research, potential collaborations, or opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me at yafuly@gmail.com.
